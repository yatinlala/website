Prefer simple, imperative code. 
Don't add comments for the sake of commenting.
Only add abstraction if you find that you are writing the same code many times.
Don't split functions up because they are two long, split based on functionality, not 
to make things look superficially cleaner. 
Prioritize fewer names over "better abstractions".
Name functions and variables based on what they actually do or store, not based on some ideal abstraction.
Prefer simple, even "ugly" code, over complex, overly abstract solutions driven by
premature optimization.
